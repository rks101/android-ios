# Android v/s iOS Ecosystem
Android v/s iOS - nice to know things  

1. [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/) is one of several repositories for Android apps. [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) is only repository for iOS apps.  

2. Android based mobile devices (smartphone and tablets) are manufactured by several OEMs - Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi (Redme, Mi, Poco), Oppo, Vivo, Motorola, Nokia, LG, Sony, Asus, Lenovo, Huawei, etc. Apple alone manufactures iOS based mobile devices (smartphone, iPad, iWatch).  

3. Android Play Store has 2.8 million apps and Apple App Store has 1.8 million apps as of December 2020.  

4. Android smartphone marketshare is staggering 84% while Apple has a 15 marketshare as per [IDC](https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os) and [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-25-gartner-says-global-smartphone-sales-declined-20--in-) reports.  

5. Individual Android apps developer is required to pay [$25 USD one-time fee](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) for publishing apps, and only for [paid apps](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html) it charges 30% of fee. Individual iOS apps developer is required to pay [$99 USD every year](https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/). Further, Apple charges 30% of fee and developer [keeps 70% of fee](https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/) for all paid apps.   

6. Android apps run multiple OS releases ranging from Android Jelly Beans v4.2 to Android v10 as of December 2020. iOS apps get updated much faster and Apple removed 2 million apps that were not updated or [not runing on latest OS releases](https://www.apple.com/app-store/).  

7. Android uses a permission based discretionery access control for [requesting permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting). Apple uses a [more restrictive and practical](https://www.howtogeek.com/177711/ios-has-app-permissions-too-and-theyre-arguably-better-than-androids/) [permission settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/requesting-permission/).  

8. Android took Location permission seriously very late from Android 10 while Apple iOS was [restricting access to Location](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033) while-in-use much earlier than Android.  

9. Android ecosystem is more fragmented due to multiple OEMs and multiple app stores. Android developer can gate-in apps faster (in-time). Apple iOS ecosystem is controlled and closely-knit and it takes longer to host an app online.
