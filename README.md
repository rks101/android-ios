# Android v/s iOS Ecosystem
Android v/s iOS - nice to know things  

1. [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/) is one of several repositories for Android apps. [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) is the only repository for iOS apps.  

2. Android based mobile devices (smartphone and tablets) are manufactured by several OEMs - Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi (Redme, Mi, Poco), Oppo, Vivo, Motorola, Nokia, LG, Sony, Asus, Lenovo, Huawei, etc. Apple alone manufactures iOS based mobile devices (smartphone, iPad, iWatch).  

3. Android Play Store has 2.8 million apps and Apple App Store has 1.8 million apps as of December 2020. By June 2018, Android has 3.6 million active apps. Both Android and iOS were unveiled in 2007.  

4. Android smartphone marketshare is staggering 84% while Apple has a 15 marketshare as per [IDC](https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os) and [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-25-gartner-says-global-smartphone-sales-declined-20--in-) reports.  

5. Individual Android apps developer is required to pay [$25 USD one-time fee](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) for publishing apps, and only for [paid apps](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2008/10/android-market-now-available-for-users.html) it charges 30% of fee. Individual iOS apps developer is required to pay [$99 USD every year](https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/). Further, Apple charges 30% of fee and developer [keeps 70% of fee](https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/) for all paid apps. Users pay through device purchases and in-app purchases. Therefore, both ecosystems are not free.  

6. Android apps run multiple OS releases ranging from Android Jelly Beans v4.2 to Android v10 as of December 2020. iOS apps get updated much faster and Apple removed 2 million apps that were not updated or [not runing on latest OS releases](https://www.apple.com/app-store/).  

7. Android uses a permission based discretionery access control for [requesting permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting). Apple uses a [more restrictive and practical](https://www.howtogeek.com/177711/ios-has-app-permissions-too-and-theyre-arguably-better-than-androids/) [permission settings](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/requesting-permission/).  

8. Android took Location permission seriously very late from Android 10 while Apple iOS was [restricting access to Location](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033) while-in-use much earlier than Android.  

9. Android ecosystem is more fragmented due to multiple OEMs and multiple app stores. Android developer can gate-in apps faster (in-time). Apple iOS ecosystem is controlled and closely-knit and it takes longer to host an app online.  

10. Android app developer uses Android Studio IDE, Java or Kotlin programming and third party app-builders are available. iOS developer uses XCode, Swift programming on Mac OS. There are hybrid app development interfaces that write once and build apps for both Android and iOS.

Q. When you should recycle or upgrade your phone?  
A. As years roll on, there is no incentive for Andoid device makers to continue supporting updates. First, you should find out the latest OS released and the OS running on your phone/tablet. If you are running three or more major versions behind, it's time for upgrade. e.g. If latest android release is v11.0 and if your phone has v8.0 or earlier OS running, you should consider upgrade. Each major release comes with many security patches and improvements. Also, check if your phone is still receiving any software updates. If your phone has not received any update in the past 12 months, enquire if there will be any update and then you should consider upgrade.
